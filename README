To use this code, import the project into eclipse and look at our main class Simulation.java. The object Simulation takes a list of parameters we will exhaustively explain in this file. Just select the parameters according the experiments you want to lead and run it.
Using loops on the parameters, you may find it useful to try different combinations and store them in a table to retrieve them later (to write on a file in our case).
Currently, the main is less modular than the other classes since, for each experiment, we have a different set of arguments to try. Thus, the table where we store our results has a hard coded size that needs to be changed each time you run the simulations with another set of parameters.

The parameters:

int number_features: Number of bits in the bit string
int computation_cost/random_move_cost: The computational cost of each kind of move, this hasn’t been used yet but we think it is relevant for further research in this area
double Pr: Probability of random move
HashMap<String,Integer> graph: the Map that contains bit strings and their scores
int MAX_TRIES: total number of tries before leaving the algorithm, if optimal solution not found
int restart_parameter: equivalent to MAX_FLIPS in SLS
double restart_probability: probability of restart at each step, we derive it from the previous parameter using the formula: restart_probability = 1/ restart_parameter
double p_init: probability of initializing correctly one bit of the initial bit string.
